# Predicting-water-pollution-

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect water pollution using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model classifies images into two categories: **polluted** and **clean**. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, it can be trained with custom datasets.

## Features

- Image classification to detect water pollution.
- Preprocessing of images to standardize input for the model.
- Augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
- Saving and loading of the trained model.

## Installation

To get started, ensure you have Python installed. You can then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
## Usage
Load a Pre-trained Model: Load a previously trained model using the following code:



from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
model = load_model('water_pollution_model.h5')
Predict on a Single Image: To predict whether an image of water is polluted or clean, use the predict_single_image function:


image_path = r"your_image_path.png"
predict_single_image(image_path)
Train a New Model: To train a new model, ensure your dataset is organized into train and test directories with subdirectories for each class (polluted and clean). Then run the training script included in the project.

## Dataset
You need to provide your own dataset of images categorized into two folders: polluted and clean. Place these folders inside a dataset/train directory for training and a dataset/test directory for validation.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images.
MaxPooling Layers: Reduce dimensionality and enhance feature extraction.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for classification.
Training
To train the model, execute the training script which sets up the data generators, builds the model, and initiates training. The model will save to water_pollution_model.h5.

## Evaluation
After training, the model evaluates its performance on the validation dataset. It outputs the test loss and accuracy to give insights into its performance.
